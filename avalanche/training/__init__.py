The :py:mod:`training` module provides a generic continual learning training
class (:py:class:`BaseStrategy`) and implementations of the most common
CL strategies. These are provided either as standalone strategies in
:py:mod:`training.strategies` or as plugins (:py:mod:`training.plugins`) that
can be easily combined with your own strategy.
