    Creates a generic scenario given a list of datasets and the respective task

    When loading the datasets from a set of fixed filelist, consider using
    the :func:`create_generic_scenario_from_filelists` helper method instead.

    In its base form, this function accepts a list of test datsets that must
    contain the same amount of datasets of the training list.
    Those pairs are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
    (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual

    that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
