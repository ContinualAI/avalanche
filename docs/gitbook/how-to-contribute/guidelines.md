# Guidelines

If you are here it means you are considering contributing to _Avalanche_. It is thanks to people like you that we are making _Avalanche_ a reality! üòç

In order to contribute the this awesome framework we recommend to go through the "_From Zero to Hero_" _Avalanche_ Tutorial:

{% content-ref url="../from-zero-to-hero-tutorial/01_introduction.md" %}
[01\_introduction.md](../from-zero-to-hero-tutorial/01\_introduction.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

In this tutorial you'll learn Avalanche _in-depth_ and learn how to extend and contribute back to the community! In particular, be sure to read the "_Contribute to Avalanche_" chapter:

{% content-ref url="../from-zero-to-hero-tutorial/09_contribute-to-avalanche.md" %}
[09\_contribute-to-avalanche.md](../from-zero-to-hero-tutorial/09\_contribute-to-avalanche.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

At the moment, we don't have a lot of rules for contributing or a strict _code of conduct_, please enjoy this freedom with a grain of salt! üòÅ
