# Ask Your Question

We know that learning a new tool may be tough at times. This is why we are here to help you 🙏

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't be afraid to ask questions, there are no stupid questions and we will always answer to you.
{% endhint %}

_However, in order to help you, we need you to help us first._ \
\
First of all, if the question is more of a _code issue_ **please use** the **** [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche/issues) **** page.\
For _general questions, ideas,_ [_feature-requests_](request-a-feature.md) _and discussions_ use [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche/discussions).

If instead, this is a _quick question about Avalanche or a request for support_, in this case you can ask us directly [on slack](https://join.slack.com/t/continualai/shared\_invite/enQtNjQxNDYwMzkxNzk0LTBhYjg2MjM0YTM2OWRkNDYzOGE0ZTIzNDQ0ZGMzNDE3ZGUxNTZmNmM1YzJiYzgwMTkyZDQxYTlkMTI3NzZkNjU) (**#avalanche** channel).\
\
In any case, please make sure to follow the steps below:

1. _Clarify your information needs._
2. _Formulate them coherently._
3. _Check if the same question or a related one can be found._
4. _Ask your question._

Then we will try to answer as swiftly as possible! 🤗
