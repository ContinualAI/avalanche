# Request a Feature

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do you think an **important feature is missing** in Avalanche? You are in the right place!
{% endhint %}

We try to keep the design of _Avalanche_ as _open_, _collaborative_ and _inclusive_ as possible. This means discussing _Avalanche_ issues, development and future ideas openly through general [ContinualAI projects meetups](https://www.continualai.org/news/#meetup), its [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/continualai/shared\_invite/enQtNjQxNDYwMzkxNzk0LTBhYjg2MjM0YTM2OWRkNDYzOGE0ZTIzNDQ0ZGMzNDE3ZGUxNTZmNmM1YzJiYzgwMTkyZDQxYTlkMTI3NzZkNjU), [Github](https://github.com/vlomonaco) and [forum](https://continualai.discourse.group).

If you'd like to add a new feature to _Avalanche_ please let us know, so we can work on it, or team up with you to make it a happen! ðŸ˜„

Features request can be opened on the appropriate [GitHub Discussion Feature-Request section](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche/discussions/categories/feature-request). Vote your preferred features and we will try to implement the most voted first!
