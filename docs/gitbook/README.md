# Avalanche: an End-to-End Library for Continual Learning

![](.gitbook/assets/avalanche_logo_with_clai.png)

**Avalanche** is an _End-to-End Continual Learning Library_ based on [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/), born within [**ContinualAI**](https://www.continualai.org/) with the unique goal of providing a **shared** and **collaborative** open-source \(MIT licensed\) **codebase** for _fast prototyping_, _training_ and _reproducible_ _evaluation_ of continual learning algorithms.

Avalanche can help _Continual Learning_ researchers and practitioners in several ways:

* _Write less code, prototype faster & reduce errors_
* _Improve reproducibility_
* _Improve modularity and reusability_
* _Increase code efficiency, scalability & portability_
* _Augment impact and usability of your research products_

The library is organized in five main modules:

* **`Benchmarks`**: This module maintains a uniform API for data handling: mostly generating a stream of data from one or more datasets. It contains all the major CL benchmarks \(similar to what has been done for [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html)\).
* **`Training`**: This module provides all the necessary utilities concerning model training. This includes simple and efficient ways of implement new _continual learning_ strategies as well as a set pre-implemented CL baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms you will be able to use for comparison!
* **`Evaluation`**: This modules provides all the utilities and metrics that can help evaluate a CL algorithm with respect to all the factors we believe to be important for a continually learning system.
* **`Models`**: In this module you'll be able to find several model architectures and pre-trained models that can be used for your continual learning experiment \(similar to what has been done in [torchvision.models](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html)\).
* **`Logging`**: It includes advanced logging and plotting features, including native _stdout_, _file_ and [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) support \(How cool it is to have a complete, interactive dashboard, tracking your experiment metrics in real-time with a single line of code?\)

_Avalanche_ the first experiment of a **End-to-end Library** for reproducible continual learning research & development where you can find _benchmarks_, _algorithms,_ _evaluation metrics_ and much more_,_ **in the same place**.

Let's make it together üë´ a wonderful ride! üéà

## üö¶ Getting Started

We know that learning a new tool _may be tough at first_. This is why we made _Avalanche_ as easy as possible to learn with a set of resources that will help you along the way.

For example, you may start with our _**5-minutes**_ **guide** that will let you acquire the basics about _Avalanche_ and how you can use it in your research project:

{% page-ref page="getting-started/learn-avalanche-in-5-minutes.md" %}

We have also prepared for you a large set of _**examples & snippets**_ you can plug-in directly into your code and play with:

Having completed these two sections, you will already feel with _superpowers_ ‚ö°, this is why we have also created an **in-depth tutorial** that will cover all the aspect of _Avalanche_ in details and make you a true _Continual Learner_! üë®‚ÄçüéìÔ∏è
