# Current Release

_Avalanche_ is a framework in constant development. Thanks to the support of the [ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org) community and its active members we plan to **extend its features** and **improve its usability** based on the demands of our research community!\
\
A the moment, _Avalanche_ is in **Beta (v0.2.0).** We support a large number of _Benchmarks_, _Strategies_ and _Metrics_, that makes it, we believe, **the best tool out there for your continual learning research!** üí™

You can find the full list of available features on the [API documentation](https://avalanche-api.continualai.org).

## Benchmarks and Datasets

You find a complete list of the features on the [benchmarks API documentation](https://avalanche-api.continualai.org/en/latest/benchmarks.html).

### üñºÔ∏è Datasets

Avalanche supports all the most popular computer vision datasets used in _Continual Learning_. Some of them are available in [_Torchvision_](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html), while other have been integrated by us. Most datasets are automatically downloaded by Avalanche.

* **Toy datasets**: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, QMNIST.
* **CIFAR:** CIFAR10, CIFAR100.
* **ImageNet**: TinyImagenet, MiniImagenet, Imagenet.
* **Others**: EndlessCLDataset, CUB200, OpenLORIS, Stream-51, INATURALIST2018, Omniglot, CLEARImage, ...

### üìö Benchmarks

All the major continual learning benchmarks are available and ready to use. Benchmarks split the datasets and create the train and test streams:

* **MNIST**: SplitMNIST, RotatedMNIST, PermutedMNIST, SplitFashionMNIST.
* **CIFAR10**: SplitCIFAR10, SplitCIFAR100, SplitCIFAR110.
* **CORe50**: all the CORe50 scenarios are supported.
* **Others**: SplitCUB200, CLStream51, CLEAR.

## üìà Continual Learning Strategies

Avalanche provides _Continual Learning_ algorithms (_strategies_). We are continuously expanding the library with new algorithms.

* **Baselines**: Naive, JointTraining, Cumulative.
* **Rehearsal**: Replay with reservoir sampling and balanced buffers, GSS greedy, CoPE.
* **Regularization**: EWC, LwF, GEM, AGEM, CWR\*, Synaptic Intelligence.
* **Architectural**: Progressive Neural Networks, multi-head, incremental classifier.
* **Others**: GDumb, iCaRL, AR1, Streaming LDA, LFL.

## Models

Avalanche uses and extends pytorch `nn.Module` to define continual learning models:

* support for `nn.Module`s and `torchvision` models.
* Dynamic output heads for class-incremental scenarios and multi heads for task-incremental scenarios.
* support for architectural strategies and dynamically expanding models such as progressive neural networks.

## üìä Metrics and Evaluation

Avalanche provides continuous evaluation of CL strategies with a large set of **Metrics**. They are collected and logged automatically by the strategy during the training and evaluation loops.

* accuracy, loss, confusion (averaged over streams or experiences).
* **CL-Metrics**: backward/forward transfer, forgetting.
* **Computational Resources**: CPU and RAM usage, MAC, execution times.
