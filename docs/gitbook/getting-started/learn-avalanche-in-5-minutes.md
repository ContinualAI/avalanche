# Learn Avalanche in 5 Minutes

_Avalanche_ is mostly about making the life of a continual learning researcher easier.

> #### What are the **three pillars** of any respectful continual learning research project?

* **`Benchmarks`**: Machine learning researchers need multiple benchmarks with efficient data handling utils to design and prototype new algorithms. Quantitative results on ever-changing benchmarks has been one of the driving forces of _Deep Learning_.
* **`Training`**: Efficient implementation and training of continual learning algorithms; comparisons with other baselines and state-of-the-art methods become fundamental to asses the quality of an original algorithmic proposal.
* **`Evaluation`**: _Training_ utils and _Benchmarks_ are not enough alone to push continual learning research forward. Comprehensive and sound _evaluation protocols_ and _metrics_ need to be employed as well.

> #### _With Avalanche, you can find all these three fundamental pieces together and much more, in a single and coherent, well-maintained codebase._

Let's take a quick tour on how you can use Avalanche for your research projects with a **5-minutes guide**, for _researchers on the run_!

{% hint style="info" %}
In this short guide we assume you have already installed _Avalanche_. If you haven't yet, check out how you can do it following our [How to Install](how-to-install.md) guide.
{% endhint %}

## üèõÔ∏è General Architecture

_Avalanche_ is organized in **five main modules**:

* **`Benchmarks`**: This module maintains a uniform API for data handling: mostly generating a stream of data from one or more datasets. It contains all the major CL benchmarks \(similar to what has been done for [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html)\).
* **`Training`**: This module provides all the necessary utilities concerning model training. This includes simple and efficient ways of implement new _continual learning_ strategies as well as a set pre-implemented CL baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms you will be able to use for comparison!
* **`Evaluation`**: This modules provides all the utilities and metrics that can help in evaluating a CL algorithm with respect to all the factors we believe to be important for a continually learning system.
* **`Models`**: In this module you'll be able to find several model architectures and pre-trained models that can be used for your continual learning experiment \(similar to what has been done in [torchvision.models](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html)\). 
* **`Logging`**: It includes advanced logging and plotting features, including native _stdout_, _file_ and [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) support \(How cool it is to have a complete, interactive dashboard, tracking your experiment metrics in real-time with a single line of code?\)

In the graphic below, you can see how _Avalanche_ sub-modules are available and organized as well:

We will learn more about each of them during this tutorial series, but keep in mind that the [Avalanche API documentation](https://continualai.github.io/avalanche) is your friend as well!

All right, let's start with the _benchmarks_ module right away üëá

## üìö Benchmarks

The benchmark module offers three main features:

1. **Datasets**: a comprehensive list of PyTorch Datasets ready to use \(It includes all the _Torchvision_ Datasets and more!\).
2. **Classic Benchmarks**: a set of classic _Continual Learning_ Benchmarks ready to be used \(there can be multiple benchmarks based on a single dataset\).
3. **Generators**: a set of functions you can use to generate your own benchmark starting from any PyTorch Dataset!

### Datasets

Datasets can be imported in _Avalanche_ as simply as:

```python
from avalanche.benchmarks.datasets import MNIST, FashionMNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST,
    QMNIST, FakeData, CocoCaptions, CocoDetection, LSUN, ImageNet, CIFAR10,
    CIFAR100, STL10, SVHN, PhotoTour, SBU, Flickr8k, Flickr30k, VOCDetection,
    VOCSegmentation, Cityscapes, SBDataset, USPS, Kinetics400, HMDB51, UCF101,
    CelebA, CORe50Dataset, TinyImagenet, CUB200, OpenLORIS, MiniImageNetDataset, Stream51
```

Of course, you can use them as you would use any _PyTorch Dataset_.

### Benchmarks Basics

The _Avalanche_ benchmarks \(instances of the _Scenario_ class\), contains several attributes that describe the benchmark. However, the most important ones are the `train` and `test streams`.

In _Avalanche_ we often suppose to have access to these **two parallel stream of data** \(even though some benchmarks may not provide such feature, but contain just a unique test set\).

Each of these `streams` are _iterable_, _indexable_ and _sliceable_ objects that are composed of **experiences**. Experiences are batch of data \(or "_tasks_"\) that can be provided with or without a specific _task label_.

### **Classic Benchmarks**

_Avalanche_ maintains a set of commonly used benchmarks built on top of one or multiple datasets.

```python
from avalanche.benchmarks.classic import CORe50, SplitTinyImageNet, SplitCIFAR10,\ 
    SplitCIFAR100, SplitCIFAR110, SplitMNIST, RotatedMNIST, PermutedMNIST, SplitCUB200

# creating the benchmark (scenario object)
perm_mnist = PermutedMNIST(
    n_experiences=3,
    seed=1234,
)

# recovering the train and test streams
train_stream = perm_mnist.train_stream
test_stream = perm_mnist.test_stream

# iterating over the train stream
for experience in train_stream:
    print("Start of task ", experience.task_label)
    print('Classes in this task:', experience.classes_in_this_experience)

    # The current Pytorch training set can be easily recovered through the 
    # experience
    current_training_set = experience.dataset
    # ...as well as the task_label
    print('Task {}'.format(experience.task_label))
    print('This task contains', len(current_training_set), 'training examples')

    # we can recover the corresponding test experience in the test stream
    current_test_set = test_stream[experience.current_experience].dataset
    print('This task contains', len(current_test_set), 'test examples')
```

### Benchmarks Generators

What if we want to create a new benchmark that is not present in the "_Classic_" ones? Well, in that case _Avalanche_ offers a number of utilities that you can use to create your own benchmark with maximum flexibility: the **benchmark generators**!

The _specific_ scenario generators are useful when starting from one or multiple PyTorch datasets and you want to create a "**New Instances**" or "**New Classes**" benchmark: i.e. it supports the easy and flexible creation of a _Domain-Incremental_, _Class-Incremental or Task-Incremental_ scenarios among others.

```python
from avalanche.benchmarks.generators import nc_scenario, ni_scenario

scenario = ni_scenario(
    mnist_train, mnist_test, n_experiences=10, shuffle=True, seed=1234,
    balance_experiences=True
)
scenario = nc_scenario(
    mnist_train, mnist_test, n_experiences=10, shuffle=True, seed=1234,
    task_labels=False
)
```

Finally, if your ideal benchmark does not fit well in the aforementioned _Domain-Incremental_, _Class-Incremental or Task-Incremental_ scenarios, you can always use our **generic generators**:

* **filelist\_scenario**
* **paths\_scenario**
* **dataset\_scenario**
* **tensor\_scenario**

```python
from avalanche.benchmarks.generators import filelist_scenario, dataset_scenario, \
                                            tensor_scenario, paths_scenario
```

You can read more about how to use them the full _Benchmarks_ module tutorial!

## üí™Training

The `training` module in _Avalanche_ is build on modularity and it has two main goals:

1. provide a set of standard **continual learning baselines** that can be easily run for comparison;
2. provide the necessary utilities to **implement and run your own strategy** in the most efficient and simple way possible thanks to the building blocks we already prepared for you.

### Strategies

If you want to compare your strategy with other classic continual learning algorithms or baselines, in _Avalanche_ this is as simple as creating an object:

```python
from avalanche.models import SimpleMLP
from avalanche.training.strategies import Naive, CWRStar, Replay, GDumb,
    Cumulative, LwF, GEM, AGEM, EWC, AR1

model = SimpleMLP(num_classes=10)
cl_strategy = Naive(
    model, SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9),
    CrossEntropyLoss(), train_mb_size=100, train_epochs=4, eval_mb_size=100
)
```

### Create your own Strategy

The simplest way to build your own strategy is to create a python class that implements the main `train` and `eval` methods.

Let's define our Continual Learning algorithm "_MyStrategy_" as a simple python class:

```python
class MyStrategy():
    """My Basic Strategy"""

    def __init__(self, model, optimizer, criterion):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.criterion = criterion

    def train(self, experience):
        # here you can implement your own training loop for each experience (i.e. 
        # batch or task).

        train_dataset = experience.dataset
        t = experience.task_label
        train_data_loader = DataLoader(
            train_dataset, num_workers=4, batch_size=128
        )

        for epoch in range(1):
            for mb in train_data_loader:
                # you magin here...
                pass

    def eval(self, experience):
        # here you can implement your own eval loop for each experience (i.e. 
        # batch or task).

        eval_dataset = experience.dataset
        t = experience.task_label
        eval_data_loader = DataLoader(
            eval_dataset, num_workers=4, batch_size=128
        )

        # eval here
```

Then, we can use our strategy as we would do for the pre-implemented ones:

```python
# Model Creation
model = SimpleMLP(num_classes=scenario.n_classes)

# Create the Strategy Instance (MyStrategy)
cl_strategy = MyStrategy(
    model, SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9),
    CrossEntropyLoss())

# Training Loop
print('Starting experiment...')

for experience in scenario.train_stream:
    print("Start of experience ", experience.current_experience)

    cl_strategy.train(experience)
    print('Training completed')

    print('Computing accuracy on the whole test set')
    cl_strategy.eval(scenario.test_stream[experience.current_experience])
```

While this is the easiest possible way to add your own strategy, _Avalanche_ supports more sophisticated modalities \(based on _callbacks_\) that lets you write **more neat, modular** and **reusable** **code**, inheriting functionality from a parent classes and using **pre-implemented plugins**.

Check out more details about what Avalanche can offer in this module following the "_Training_" chapter of the **"**_**From Zero to Hero**_**"** tutorial!

## üìà Evaluation

The `evaluation` module is quite straightforward: it offers all the basic functionalities to evaluate and keep track of a continual learning experiment.

This is mostly done through the **Metrics** and the **Loggers.** The **Metrics** provide a set of classes which implements the main continual learning metrics like A_ccuracy_, F_orgetting_, M_emory Usage_, R_unning Times_, etc.  
Metrics should be created via the utility functions \(e.g. `accuracy_metrics`, `timing_metrics`and others\) specifying in the arguments when those metrics should be computed \(after each minibatch, epoch, experience etc...\).  
The **Loggers** specify a way to report the metrics \(e.g. with Tensorboard, on console or others\). Loggers are created by instantiating the respective class.

Metrics and loggers interact via the **Evaluation Plugin:** this is the main object responsible of tracking the experiment progress. Metrics and loggers are directly passed to the `EvaluationPlugin` instance. You will see the output of the loggers automatically during training and evaluation! Let's see how to put this together in few lines of code:

```python
# utility functions to create plugin metrics
from avalanche.evaluation.metrics import accuracy_metrics, \
loss_metrics, forgetting_metrics
from avalanche.loggers import InteractiveLogger, TensorboardLogger
from avalanche.training.plugins import EvaluationPlugin

eval_plugin = EvaluationPlugin(
    # accuracy after each training epoch
    # and after each evaluation experience
    accuracy_metrics(epoch=True, experience=True),
    # loss after each training minibatch and each
    # evaluation stream
    loss_metrics(minibatch=True, stream=True),
    # catastrophic forgetting after each evaluation
    # experience
    forgetting_metrics(experience=True, stream=True), 
    # add as many metrics as you like
    loggers=[InteractiveLogger(), TensorboardLogger()])

# pass the evaluation plugin instance to the strategy
# strategy = EWC(..., evaluator=eval_plugin)

# THAT'S IT!!
```

## üîó Putting all Together

You've learned how to install _Avalanche,_ how to create benchmarks that can suit your needs, how you can create your own continual learning algorithm and how you can evaluate its performance.

Here we show how you can use all these modules together to **design your experiments** as quantitative supporting evidence for your research project or paper.

```python
from avalanche.benchmarks.classic import SplitMNIST
from avalanche.evaluation.metrics import forgetting_metrics, accuracy_metrics,\
    loss_metrics, timing_metrics, cpu_usage_metrics, StreamConfusionMatrix,\
    disk_usage_metrics, gpu_usage_metrics
from avalanche.models import SimpleMLP
from avalanche.logging import InteractiveLogger, TextLogger, TensorboardLogger
from avalanche.training.plugins import EvaluationPlugin
from avalanche.training.strategies import Naive

from torch.optim import SGD
from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss

scenario = SplitMNIST(n_experiences=5)

# MODEL CREATION
model = SimpleMLP(num_classes=scenario.n_classes)

# DEFINE THE EVALUATION PLUGIN and LOGGERS
# The evaluation plugin manages the metrics computation.
# It takes as argument a list of metrics, collectes their results and returns 
# them to the strategy it is attached to.

# log to Tensorboard
tb_logger = TensorboardLogger()

# log to text file
text_logger = TextLogger(open('log.txt', 'a'))

# print to stdout
interactive_logger = InteractiveLogger()

eval_plugin = EvaluationPlugin(
    accuracy_metrics(minibatch=True, epoch=True, experience=True, stream=True),
    loss_metrics(minibatch=True, epoch=True, experience=True, stream=True),
    timing_metrics(epoch=True),
    cpu_usage_metrics(experience=True),
    forgetting_metrics(experience=True, stream=True),
    StreamConfusionMatrix(num_classes=scenario.n_classes, save_image=False),
    disk_usage_metrics(minibatch=True, epoch=True, experience=True, stream=True),
    loggers=[interactive_logger, text_logger, tb_logger]
)

# CREATE THE STRATEGY INSTANCE (NAIVE)
cl_strategy = Naive(
    model, SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9),
    CrossEntropyLoss(), train_mb_size=500, train_epochs=1, eval_mb_size=100,
    evaluator=eval_plugin)

# TRAINING LOOP
print('Starting experiment...')
results = []
for experience in scenario.train_stream:
    print("Start of experience: ", experience.current_experience)
    print("Current Classes: ", experience.classes_in_this_experience)

    # train returns a dictionary which contains all the metric values
    res = cl_strategy.train(experience, num_workers=4)
    print('Training completed')

    print('Computing accuracy on the whole test set')
    # eval also returns a dictionary which contains all the metric values
    results.append(cl_strategy.eval(scenario.test_stream, num_workers=4))
```
