# Loggers

_Avalanche_ offers concrete support for using standard logger like csv file, TensorBoard, etc. or even  _defining your own loggers_. You can find **examples** related to the benchmarks here:&#x20;

* [Tensorboard logger](../../../examples/tensorboard\_logger.py): _this is a simple example that shows how to use the Tensorboard Logger._
* [WandB logger](../../../examples/wandb\_logger.py): _This is a simple example that shows how to use the WandB Logger._
