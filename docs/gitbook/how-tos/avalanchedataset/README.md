# AvalancheDataset

The `AvalancheDataset` is an implementation of the PyTorch `Dataset` class that comes with many useful out-of-the-box functionalities. For most users, the *AvalancheDataset* can be used as a plain PyTorch Dataset. For classification problems, `AvalancheDataset` return `x, y, t` elements (input, target, task label). However, the `AvalancheDataset` can be easily extended for any custom needs. 

**A serie of _Mini How-Tos_** will guide you through the functionalities of the *AvalancheDataset* and its subclasses:
