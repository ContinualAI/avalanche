# AvalancheDataset

The `AvalancheDataset` is an implementation of the PyTorch `Dataset` class that comes with many useful out-of-the-box functionalities. For most users, the *AvalancheDataset* can be used as a plain PyTorch Dataset that will return `x, y, t` elements. However, the AvalancheDataset is much more powerful than a simple PyTorch Dataset. 

**A serie of _Mini How-Tos_** will guide you through the functionalities of the *AvalancheDataset* and its subclasses:

- [Preamble: PyTorch Datasets](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/preamble-pytorch-datasets)
- [Creating AvalancheDatasets](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/creating-avalanchedatasets)
- [Advanced Transformations](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/advanced-transformations)

Brefore jumping to the actual *Mini How-To*s, **we recommend having a look at the basic notions of Dataset and DataLoader by reading the [Preamble page](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/preamble-pytorch-datasets)**.
