# Extending Avalanche


```python
!pip install avalanche-lib
```


Having learned how to use all the _Avalanche_ main features, you may end up willing to customize the framework a little to suit your eagerness of continually better functionalities \(as a true _continual learner_ would indeed do! ⚡\).

Hence, now is the time to get your hands dirty! 🙌

Take you time to explore the [Avalanche API](https://continualai.github.io/avalanche) in great detail. We made sure everything is well documented \(even if improvable\), but try to take a look at the code as well to resolve any uncertainties \(of course if you have any question [don't hesitate to ask](../questions-and-issues/ask-your-question.md)\)

You can start by [cloning the repo and installing Avalanche in "Developer Mode"](../getting-started/how-to-install.md#developer-mode-install).

We suggest to delve into the code using an appropriate IDE, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This will help you navigate the code better and with tons of cool discovery features. Once you have a clear understanding of the entire codebase \(or at least the module you'd like to extend/customize\) you can start making changes.

If you think your changes may be interesting for the rest of the _Continual Learning_ community, why not contributing back to Avalanche? You can learn how to do it in the next chapter.
