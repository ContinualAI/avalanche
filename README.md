**Avalanche** is an *end-to-end Continual Learning library* based on **Pytorch**, born within [ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org/) with the unique goal of providing a shared and collaborative 
open-source (MIT licensed) codebase for fast prototyping, training and reproducible evaluation of continual learning algorithms. 
Avalanche can help Continual Learning researchers in several ways:

- *Write less code, prototype faster & reduce errors*
- *Improve reproducibility*
- *Improve modularity and reusability*
- *Increase code efficiency, scalability & portability*
- *Augment impact and usability of your research products*

The library is organized into four main modules:

- [Benchmarks](avalanche/benchmarks): This module maintains a uniform API for data handling: mostly generating a stream of data from one or more datasets. It contains all the major CL benchmarks (similar to what has been done for torchvision).
- [Training](avalanche/training): This module provides all the necessary utilities concerning model training. This includes simple and efficient ways of implement new continual learning strategies as well as a set of pre-implemented CL baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms you will be able to use for comparison!
- [Evaluation](avalanche/evaluation): This module provides all the utilities and metrics that can help evaluate a CL algorithm with respect to all the factors we believe to be important for a continually learning system. It also includes advanced logging and plotting features, including native Tensorboard support.
- [Models](avalanche/models): This module provides utilities to implement model expansion and task-aware models, along with a set of pre-trained models and popular architectures that can be used for your continual learning experiment (similar to what has been done in torchvision.models).
- [Logging](avalanche/logging): It includes advanced logging and plotting features, including native stdout, file and TensorBoard support (How cool it is to have a complete, interactive dashboard, tracking your experiment metrics in real-time with a single line of code?)

_Avalanche_ the first experiment of an **End-to-end Library** for reproducible continual learning research & development where you can find benchmarks, algorithms, evaluation metrics and much more, in the same place.

Let's make it together :people_holding_hands: a wonderful ride! :balloon:

Check out below how you can start using Avalanche! :point_down:

Quick Example
----------------

```python
import torch
from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss
from torch.optim import SGD

from avalanche.benchmarks.classic import PermutedMNIST
from avalanche.models import SimpleMLP
from avalanche.training import Naive


# Config
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
# model
model = SimpleMLP(num_classes=10)

# CL Benchmark Creation
perm_mnist = PermutedMNIST(n_experiences=3)
train_stream = perm_mnist.train_stream
test_stream = perm_mnist.test_stream

# Prepare for training & testing
optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()

# Continual learning strategy
cl_strategy = Naive(
    model, optimizer, criterion, train_mb_size=32, train_epochs=2,
    eval_mb_size=32, device=device)

# train and test loop over the stream of experiences
results = []
for train_exp in train_stream:
    cl_strategy.train(train_exp)
    results.append(cl_strategy.eval(test_stream))
```

Current Release
----------------

Avalanche is a framework in constant development. Thanks to the support of the [ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org/) community and its active members we are quickly extending its features and improve its usability based on the demands of our research community!

A the moment, Avalanche is in [**Beta (v0.2.0)**](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche/releases/tag/v0.2.0). We support [several *Benchmarks*, *Strategies* and *Metrics*](https://avalanche.continualai.org/getting-started/alpha-version), that make it, we believe, the best tool out there for your continual learning research! ðŸ’ª

**You can install Avalanche by running `pip install avalanche-lib`.**  
This will install the core Avalanche package. You can install Avalanche with extra packages to enable more functionalities.  
Look [here](https://avalanche.continualai.org/getting-started/how-to-install) for a more complete guide on the different ways available to install Avalanche.

Getting Started
----------------

We know that learning a new tool may be tough at first. This is why we made Avalanche as easy as possible to learn with a set of resources that will help you along the way.
For example, you may start with our 5-minutes guide that will let you acquire the basics about Avalanche and how you can use it in your research project:

- [Getting Started Guide](https://avalanche.continualai.org/getting-started)

We have also prepared for you a large set of examples & snippets you can plug-in directly into your code and play with:

- [Avalanche Examples](https://avalanche.continualai.org/examples)

Having completed these two sections, you will already feel with superpowers âš¡, this is why we have also created an in-depth tutorial that will cover all the aspects of Avalanche in 
detail and make you a true Continual Learner! :woman_student:

- [From Zero to Hero Tutorial](https://avalanche.continualai.org/from-zero-to-hero-tutorial)

Cite Avalanche
----------------
If you used Avalanche in your research project, please remember to cite our reference paper published at the [CLVision @ CVPR2021](https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2021/overview?authuser=0) workshop: ["Avalanche: an End-to-End Library for Continual Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00405). 
This will help us make Avalanche better known in the machine learning community, ultimately making a better tool for everyone:
