"""
The :py:mod:`logging` module provides a set of utilities that can be used for
logging your experiment metrics results  on stdout, logfile and browser-based
dashboard such as "Tensorboard" and "Weights & Biases". These resources are
provided in :py:mod:`interactive_logging`, :py:mod:`text_logging` and
:py:mod:`tensorboard_logger` respectively. Loggers do not specify
which metrics to monitor, but only the way metrics will be reported
to the user. Please, see :py:mod:`evaluation` module for a list of
metrics and how to use them.
Loggers should be passed as parameters to the `EvaluationPlugin`
in order to properly monitor the training and evaluation flows.
