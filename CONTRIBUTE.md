# How to Contribute
We need to take care of the way we're going to contribute to the project.

We welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Create or Assign an existing to yourself.
3. Make a pull request

## The following rules should be respected
* Do no push commits directly to the master
* I will merge your PRs into the master
* Always pull before pushing a commit

## Coding Style  
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length
* PEP8 formatting
