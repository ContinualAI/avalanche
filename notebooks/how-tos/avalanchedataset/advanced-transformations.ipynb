    "AvalancheDataset (and its subclasses like the Avalanche*Tensor/Subset/Concat*Dataset) allow for a finer control over transformations. While torchvision (and other) datasets allow for a minimal mechanism to apply transformations, with AvalancheDataset one can:\n",
    "1. Have multiple **transformation \"groups\"** in the same dataset (like separated train and test transformations).\n",
    "2. **Append, replace and remove transformations**, even by using nested Subset/Concat Datasets.\n",
    "3. **Freeze transformations**, so that they can't be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sub-sections show examples on how to use these features. Please note that all the constructor parameters and the methods described in this How-To can be used on AvalancheDataset subclasses as well. For more info on all the available subclasses, refer to [this Mini How-To](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/creating-avalanchedatasets).\n",

    "## Transformation groups\n",
    "AvalancheDatasets can contain multiple **transformation groups**. This can be useful to keep train and test transformations in the same dataset and to have different set of transformations. This may come in handy in many situations (for instance, to apply ad-hoc transformations to replay data).\n",
    "\n",
    "As in torchvision datasets, AvalancheDataset supports the two kind of transformations: the `transform`, which is applied to X values, and the `target_transform`, which is applied to Y values. The latter is rarely used. This means that **a transformation group is a pair of transformations to be applied to the X and Y values** of each instance returned by the dataset. In both torchvision and Avalanche implementations, **a transformation must be a function (or other callable object)** that accepts one input (the X or Y value) and outputs its transformed version. This pair of functions is stored in the `transform` and `target_transform` fields of the dataset. A comprehensive guide on transformations can be found in the [torchvision documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, a MNIST dataset is created and then wrapped in an AvalancheDataset. When creating the AvalancheDataset, we can set *train* and *eval* transformations by passing a *transform\\_groups* parameter. Train transformations usually include some form of random augmentation, while eval transformations usually include a sequence of deterministic transformations only. Here we define the sequence of train transformations as a random rotation followed by the ToTensor operation. The eval transformations only include the ToTensor operation."
