    "### 📑 The Logging Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we have learned how to evaluate a continual learning algorithm in _Avalanche_, through different metrics that can be used _off-the-shelf_ via the _Evaluation Plugin_ or stand-alone. However, computing metrics and collecting results, may not be enough at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "While running complex experiments with long _waiting times_, **logging** results over-time is fundamental to \"_babysit_\" your experiments in real-time, or even understand what went wrong in the aftermath.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why in Avalanche we decided to put a strong emphasis on logging and **provide a number of loggers** that can be used with any set of metrics!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loggers\n",
    "\n",
    "_Avalanche_ at the moment supports four main Loggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **InteractiveLogger**: This logger provides a nice progress bar and displays real-time metrics results in an interactive way \\(meant for `stdout`\\).\n",
    "* **TextLogger**: This logger, mostly intended for file logging, is the plain text version of the `InteractiveLogger`. Keep in mind that it may be very verbose.\n",
    "* **TensorboardLogger**: It logs all the metrics on [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) in real-time. Perfect for real-time plotting.\n",
    "* **WandBLogger**: It leverages [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) tools to log metrics and results on a dashboard. It requires a W&B account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep track of when each metric value has been logged, we leverage two `global counters`, one for the training phase, one for the evaluation phase. \n",
    "You can see the `global counter` value reported in the x axis of the logged plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `global counter` is an ever-increasing value which starts from 0 and it is increased by one each time a training/evaluation iteration is performed (i.e. after each training/evaluation minibatch).\n",
    "The `global counters` are updated automatically by the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
