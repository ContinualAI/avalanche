    "Take you time to explore the [Avalanche API](https://avalanche-api.continualai.org) in great detail. We made sure everything is well documented \\(even if improvable\\), but try to take a look at the code as well to resolve any uncertainties \\(of course if you have any question [don't hesitate to ask](https://avalanche.continualai.org/questions-and-issues/add-your-issue)\\)\n",

    "We suggest to delve into the code using an appropriate IDE, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This will help you navigate the code better and with tons of cool discovery features. Once you have a clear understanding of the entire codebase \\(or at least the module you'd like to extend/customize\\) you can start making changes.\n",
