    "## 🎯 Nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, let's clarify a bit the nomenclature we are going to use, introducing the following terms: `Datasets`, `Scenarios`, `Benchmarks` and `Generators`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By `Dataset` we mean a **collection of examples** that can be used for training or testing purposes but not already organized to be processed as a stream of batches or tasks. Since Avalanche is based on Pytorch, our Datasets are [torch.utils.Datasets](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataset.html#Dataset) objects.\n",
    "* By `Scenario` we mean a **particular setting**, i.e. specificities about the continual stream of data, a continual learning algorithm will face.\n",
    "* By `Benchmark` we mean a well-defined and carefully thought **combination of a scenario with one or multiple datasets** that we can use to asses our continual learning algorithms.\n",
    "* By `Generator` we mean a function that **given a specific scenario and a dataset can generate a Benchmark**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 The Benchmarks Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bechmarks` module offers 3 types of utils:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datasets**: all the Pytorch datasets plus additional ones prepared by our community and particularly interesting for continual learning.\n",
    "* **Classic Benchmarks**: classic benchmarks used in CL litterature ready to be used with great flexibility.\n",
    "* **Benchmarks Generators**: a set of functions you can use to create your own benchmark starting from any kind of data and scenario. In particular, we distinguish two type of generators: `Specific` and `Generic`. The first ones will let you create a benchmark based on a clear scenarios and Pytorch dataset\\(s\\); the latters, instead, are more generic and flexible, both in terms of scenario definition then in terms of type of data they can manage.\n",
    "  * _Specific_:\n",
    "    * **nc\\_benchmark**: given one or multiple datasets it creates a benchmark instance based on scenarios where _New Classes_ \\(NC\\) are encountered over time. Notable scenarios that can be created using this utility include _Class-Incremental_, _Task-Incremental_ and _Task-Agnostic_ scenarios.\n",
    "    * **ni\\_benchmark**: it creates a benchmark instance based on scenarios where _New Instances_ \\(NI\\), i.e. new examples of the same classes are encountered over time. Notable scenarios that can be created using this utility include _Domain-Incremental_ scenarios.\n",
    "  * _Generic_:\n",
    "    * **filelist\\_benchmark**: It creates a benchmark instance given a list of filelists.\n",
    "    * **paths\\_benchmark**:  It creates a benchmark instance given a list of file paths and class labels.\n",
    "    * **tensors\\_benchmark**: It creates a benchmark instance given a list of tensors.\n",
    "    * **dataset\\_benchmark**: It creates a benchmark instance given a list of pytorch datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's see how we can use this module in practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖼️ Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the `Datasets`. As we previously hinted, in _Avalanche_ you'll find all the standard Pytorch Datasets available in the torchvision package as well as a few others that are useful for continual learning but not already officially available within the Pytorch ecosystem."

    "## 🛠️ Benchmarks Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Avalanche_ benchmarks \\(instances of the _Scenario_ class\\), contains several attributes that characterize the benchmark. However, the most important ones are the `train` and `test streams`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In _Avalanche_ we often suppose to have access to these **two parallel stream of data** \\(even though some benchmarks may not provide such feature, but contain just a unique test set\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these `streams` are _iterable_, _indexable_ and _sliceable_ objects that are composed of unique **experiences**. Experiences are batch of data \\(or \"_tasks_\"\\) that can be provided with or without a specific task label.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that all the data belonging to a _stream_ are not loaded into the RAM beforehand. Avalanche actually loads the data when a specific _mini-batches_ are requested at training/test time based on the policy defined by each `Dataset` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that memory requirements are very low, while the speed is guaranteed by a multi-processing data loading system based on the one defined in Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
